# A-Medical-Price-Prediction-System
Masters Project: I have developed a medical price prediction system using machine learning algorithms which will aid in steering patients to cost effective providers and thereby curb health spending. The policymakers can also use the tool to better understand which providers are relatively expensive and take punitive actions if necessary. The prediction of the medical price is done using implementing Regression Trees and Random Forest Regression algorithm in machine learning from scratch. Additionally, I have included the experiments on the same data with other machine learning models such as Gradient Boosted Trees and Linear Regression and compared the results. 
STEPS:
Download two datasets:1) Medicare Payment Data: https://data.cms.gov/Medicare-Inpatient/ Inpatient-Prospective-Payment-System-IPPS-Provider/97k6-zzx3, 2017 2) Housing Price Data: https://www.zillow.com/research/data/
Pre-process and combine two datasets using DataPreprocessing.py and DataPreprocessing1.py.
Predict the medical prices using LinearRegression.py and GardientBoostedRegression.py which use in-built libraries from python scikit-learn.
Predict the medical prices using RegressionTrees.py and RandomForestRegression.py which are implemented from scratch.
